# Imitation Learning for Semiconductor Wafer Dataset 🖥️

## 📖 Overview

This notebook demonstrates the application of **Imitation Learning (IL)** to learn patterns for marking certain cells as 'x' in a **semiconductor wafer dataset**. The objective is for the agent to learn from expert demonstrations and mimic the pattern of marking 'x' on a new, unseen dataset. By leveraging imitation learning, the agent generalizes its learned behavior to unseen data without requiring explicit trial-and-error exploration.

Imitation Learning is a type of **reinforcement learning** in which the agent learns by observing an expert's actions. Rather than exploring the environment and learning from rewards, the agent seeks to replicate the actions of the expert on new data.

## 🧠 Problem Definition

In this context, the goal is to mark cells on a **semiconductor wafer** by mimicking an expert’s actions. The dataset consists of grid-like structures with features representing different aspects of the semiconductor production process. 

Formally, the problem is defined as:

- **State Space (S):** The grid of cells representing the semiconductor wafer, where each cell is described by features such as material type, position, and size.
- **Action Space (A):** The possible actions the agent can take for each cell—marking the cell as 'x' or leaving it unchanged (binary action).
- **Demonstrations (D):** A set of expert-provided sequences, where each sequence consists of state-action pairs \( (s_t, a_t) \), showing how the expert marks the cells in specific patterns across the wafer.
- **Goal:** Learn a policy \( \pi \) that maps the state \( s \) to an action \( a \), such that the agent mimics the expert’s marking pattern on a new, unseen dataset.

## 🎯 Methodology

### 1. **Imitation Learning Setup**

The agent is trained to **imitate** the expert’s behavior, observing demonstrations and attempting to replicate the expert’s actions for unseen data. The process follows these steps:

- **Expert Demonstration**: The expert provides a sequence of state-action pairs \( (s_t, a_t) \), where \( s_t \) is the state at time \( t \), and \( a_t \) is the corresponding action (marking the cell as 'x' or leaving it).
- **Learning Task**: The agent learns a policy \( \pi_{\text{IL}} \) that approximates the expert’s actions from the given demonstrations.

### 2. **Learning Model**

The imitation learning model typically involves a **supervised learning approach**, where the agent learns from the expert's labeled state-action pairs. The objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the agent’s predicted actions and the expert's actions:

- **Loss Function**: A common loss function used is the **cross-entropy loss**:

  \[
  \mathcal{L}(\pi) = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(a_t | s_t)
  \]

  where \( P(a_t | s_t) \) is the probability distribution over actions predicted by the agent's policy for state \( s_t \), and \( a_t \) is the expert’s action at time \( t \).

- **Training Objective**: The agent learns to predict the action \( a_t \) from state \( s_t \) in such a way that the learned policy \( \pi_{\text{IL}} \) mimics the expert's behavior as closely as possible.

### 3. **Generalization to Unseen Data**

Once the agent is trained on expert demonstrations, it should be able to apply the learned policy \( \pi_{\text{IL}} \) to an unseen dataset, marking cells based on the learned patterns. This step tests the generalization ability of the agent, where it replicates the expert's behavior on new wafer grids that were not part of the training set.

## 🚀 Key Concepts

- **Imitation Learning (IL):** A form of learning where the agent replicates the behavior of an expert based on demonstrations.
- **State-Action Pair:** A pair consisting of the state \( s_t \) (the environment at time \( t \)) and the corresponding action \( a_t \) taken by the expert.
- **Policy \( \pi_{\text{IL}} \):** The learned function that maps a state \( s_t \) to an action \( a_t \), approximating the expert’s behavior.
- **Loss Function:** A measure of how far the agent’s predictions are from the expert’s actions, typically minimized during training.
